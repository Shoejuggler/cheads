            <p><h3>Scared a big ol' nasty virus might scramble your computer's brains? Here are some simple tips to 
            protect your system from viral infections.</h3></p>
            <ul>
           <li><span class="virus">Install Antivirus software: </span>While they aren't absolute cure-alls, aniti-virus software
           will protect your computer from most infections. Plus they are constantly being updated to protect against new viral variants.</li>
               
                <li><span class="virus2">Install crucial system updates:</span>Like anitvirus software, system updates fix bugs and
                system vulnerabilities that viruses exploit. Relax, you can still keep ignoring those Windows 10 update prompts.</li>
           </ul>

                 <ul>
                <li><span class="virus">Read dialogue boxes before agreeing to them:</span> Always inspect dialogue boxes before clicking "okay".
                Popups will sometimes disguise themselves as notifications from your computer, claiming you've been infected with virus
                and that agreeing to the pop up will install a fix. Don't fall for thier lies, they're traps.
                </li>
            
                <li><span class="virus2">Don't open suspicious email attachments:</span> The <b>oldest</b> trick in the book. Play it safe
                and don't open email attachments unless you know the sender. When in doubt, enter the text from the email in a search engine
                to look for any reports of viral carriers matching that description.
