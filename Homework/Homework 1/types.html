           <h3> Here are some of the different types of viruses that can infect your computer:</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p><ul>
                <li><span class="virus">Boot Sector Viruses:</span>These are some of the most dangerous viruses for a computer user. They lodge themselves deep into a computer's master 
                boot record, which makes them hard to remove without a full system format. They spread through removable media, like CDs and USB drives.
                Fourtunately, moderen improvements in BIOS technology has decreased their overall effectiveness.</li>
               <br>
               <li><span class="virus2">Direct Action Virus:</span>A non-resident virus that attaches itself to EXE or COM files, and infects other files in the directory when activated. 
                Not the most threatening virus as they are easy to remove with anti-virus software. </li>
                <br>
                <li><span class="virus">Resident Virus:</span> A virus that installs itself on a computer. They are considered very dangerous since they can still attack a computer 
                even after the source of infection has been deleted. This virus comes in two varients: slow and fast. The slow version corrupts files over time, making it hard to spot before the 
                damage is done. The fast variation infects computers as quickly as possible, which also makes it easier to find.</li>

           <br>
           <li><span class="virus2">Multipartite Virus:</span> Unlike the previous examples, the Multipartite Virus unleashes multiple similtanious attacks
           on a computer. It can infect the boot sector and EXE files, allowing it to spead quickly throughout the rest of the system.
           This makes the virus very hard to remove.</li>
