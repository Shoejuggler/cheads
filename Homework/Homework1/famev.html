                <li><span class="virus">ILOVEYOU(2000): </span>Widely believed to be one of the most potent viruses created.
                It attacked 10% computers all over the world through an emil message that read "I Love You"
                When opened, the virus sent itself to everyone on the victums mailing list before overwriting all files on the infected computer.
                It caused roughly $10 billion in damages</li>
              
                <li><span class="virus2">Code Red (2001):</span> Made to exploit a buffer overflow bug in Microsoft IIS web servers.
               By making hundreds of copies of itself on the memory of the infected IIS-aided computer, it would overload the system's resources.
               It will then lanch a denial of service attack on several websites, including the White House, 
               before crating a backdoor on the server for its creators to exploit. 
               Code Red infected 1-2 million servers, and cost businesses $2 billion in lost productivity.</li>

                <li><span class="virus">Sasser (2004):</span> Also takes advntage of buffer overflow problems.
                After attacking a computer's Local Security Authority Subsystem Service, it slows down and crashes the infected PC after sending itself through the internet to infect more victums.
                Sasser infected millions of computers, including those used by airlines, news agencies, public transportation, hospitals, public transport, etc.
                It caused an estimated $18 billion in damages.
